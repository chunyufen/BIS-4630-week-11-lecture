# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; "The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total." - Course Handbook.

* Practical meaning: 300 hours = **2.5 hours per day** x *5 days* x 24 learning weeks (Note: only 18 learning weeks for Hong Kong)

---

# Master's degree in UK

&gt; "[A] master's [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . . Postgraduate study is *much more independent* than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be *working by yourself for much of the time*." - [Taking the plunge into the master's world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# FCPA Introduction

* Historical background

 &gt; "Congress enacted the FCPA in 1977 after revelations of     widespread global corruption in the wake of the Watergate     political scandal. SEC discovered that more than 400 U.S.     companies had paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to     foreign government officials to secure business overseas. SEC     reported that companies were using secret slush funds to make     illegal campaign contributions in the United States and corrupt     payments to foreign officials abroad and were falsifying their     corporate financial records to conceal the payments." (USG)

# Compliance

* Tone at the top

    + A commitment from senior management and a clearly articulated     policy against corruption. (USG)

* Code of Conduct and Compliance and Policies

    + The code of conduct is the foundation of an effective compliance     programme. Policies and procedures detailing proper internal     controls, auditing practices, documentation policies and     disciplinary measures should be in place. (USG)

* Oversight, Autonomy and Resources

    + Individuals in charge of oversight should be autonomous from     management and should have sufficient resources to ensure the     programme is implemented correctly. (USG)

---

# Compliance

* Risk Assessment

    + Companies should analyse and address the specific risks they     face. (USG)

* Training

    + Companies should take the appropriate steps to ensure that the     policies and procedures have been communicated throughout the     organization. (USG)

* Incentives and Disciplinary Measures

    + Clear disciplinary procedures should be in place and the     adherence to compliance policies and procedures should be     incentivised throughout the company. (USG)

---

# Compliance

* Third-Party Due Diligence and Payments

    + Third-parties should be assessed regularly and should be     informed of the company's compliance programme and code of     conduct. (USG)

* Reporting

    + Employees should be able to report violations without fear of     retaliation through a whistleblowing mechanism based on     confidentiality. The compliance programme and internal controls     should be updated after an internal investigation. (USG)

* Testing and Review

    + As a company's business and environment in which it operates     changes over time, a good compliance programme should be     reviewed and constantly evolve over time. (USG)

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* [see website of Norton Rose Fulbright](http://bit.ly/2iEA2TT) (NRF)

* Bribery of foreign (public) officials

* Private-to-private bribery

* Active and passive bribery

* Failure to prevent bribery

* Intent

* Facilitation payments

* Promotional expenses

* Penalties

* Jurisdiction

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Bribery of foreign (public) officials

&gt; "Both the Bribery Act and the FCPA make it an offence to bribe     foreign (public) officials. Under the Bribery Act a "foreign     public official" is defined more narrowly than under the FCPA     but still includes (i) anyone who holds a foreign legislative or     judicial position; (ii) individuals who exercise a public     function for a foreign country, territory, public agency or     public enterprise; or (iii) any official or agent of a public     organisation." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Private-to-private bribery

&gt; "The FCPA does not cover bribery on a private level, unlike the     Bribery Act, although such conduct can be caught under other US     legislation." (NRF)
---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Active and passive bribery

&gt; "The FCPA only covers active bribery, that is to say the giving     of a bribe. In contrast, the Bribery Act prohibits both active     and passive bribery i.e. the taking of a bribe." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Failure to prevent bribery

&gt; "The Bribery Act creates a strict liability corporate offence     for failure to prevent bribery (as opposed to vicarious     liability) subject to being able to establish that a company has     "adequate procedures". Under the FCPA, however, a company     subject to US jurisdiction can be held vicariously liable for     acts of its employees and agents. The UK offence extends to acts     of "associated persons" which means anyone who performs services     for or on behalf of the commercial organisation." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Intent

&gt; "Under the FCPA it must be proved that the person offering the     bribe did so with a "corrupt" intent. The Bribery Act makes no     requirement for a "corrupt" or "improper" intent in relation to     the bribery of a foreign public official, although the     requirement remains for the general bribery offence." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Facilitation payments

&gt; "The FCPA creates an exemption for facilitation payments whereas     the Bribery Act makes no such exception. The Ministry of Justice     guidance, however, confirms that prosecutors will exercise     discretion in determining whether to prosecute. In addition,     informal guidance received from the SFO indicates that where it     is considering action, it will be guided by six principles."     (NRF)

* Six principles:

    + . . .

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Six principles:

    + Whether the company has a clear and issued policy.

    + whether the company has written guidance available to employees     as to the procedures they must follow where a facilitation     payment is requested or expected.

    + whether such procedures are really being followed (monitoring).

    + evidence that gifts are being recorded at the company.

    + proper action, collective or otherwise, to inform the     appropriate authorities in countries when a breach of the policy     occurs.

    + the company is taking what practical steps it can to curtail     such payments.
---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Promotional expenses

&gt; "The FCPA provides for a 'defence' to promotional expenses in so     far as it can be demonstrated that they were a reasonable and     bona fide expenditure. There is no such defence concerning     promotional expenses under the Bribery Act, in relation to     foreign public officials, although the Ministry of Justice has     provided some comfort on this aspect in its guidance." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Penalties

&gt; "An individual found to have committed an offence under the     Bribery Act is liable to imprisonment of up to ten years and/or     to an unlimited fine. A company found guilty is subject to an     unlimited fine. For offences committed under the FCPA an     individual can be fined up to US\$250,000 per violation and may     also be given up to five years imprisonment. A company guilty     under the FCPA is liable for a fine of up to US\$2,000,000 per     violation." (NRF)

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Extra-territoriality

&gt; "The FCPA applies broadly to numerous categories of US and     non-US persons and businesses, and in many cases can give rise     to liability even where the corrupt act takes place entirely or     mostly outside the United States Under the Bribery Act, once it     is established that a commercial organisation carries on a     business or part of a business in the UK, if an associated     person bribes another person or a foreign public official for     its benefit, the organisation may be guilty of the offense     unless it can demonstrate that it had adequate procedures in     place to prevent such conduct. . . . "

---

# Main differences between BA 2010 and FCPA

* Extra-territoriality

&gt; ". . . Theoretically, a parent company incorporated in Australia whose     agent based in Vietnam bribes a Chinese official for the     parent's benefit could be prosecuted in the UK because its     subsidiary is located in London, regardless of the fact that the     subsidiary is uninvolved in the offense. In this way, the     jurisdictional reach of the offense of failure to prevent     bribery is broader than the jurisdictional reach of the Bribery     Offenses, in that the former extends to overseas commercial     organisations that carry on a business or part of a business in     the UK whereas the latter are restricted to entities with a     close connection with the UK."

---

# U.S. Anti-Corruption Efforts

* [An Overview of State and Local Anti-Corruption Oversight in the United States](http://bit.ly/2lv9DbI) 

&gt; "The United States has a decentralized system of anti-corruption oversight unique in the world. Instead of a national anti-corruption agency, like most countries, the federal government has a profusion of institutions including the Government Accountability Office in the legislative branch, the Office of Government Ethics in the executive branch, and more than 70 inspectors general responsible for monitoring a specific department or program."

---

# U.S. Anti-Corruption Efforts

&gt; "At the state level, the oversight landscape is even more variegated. Some states, cities, and counties have multiple agencies while others have one or none at all. Some watchdog agencies have large staffs with sweeping investigative powers, while others are volunteer boards that meet rarely and lack means of enforcement. Each jurisdiction's institutions have evolved largely in isolation, in response to local political pressures and other factors, with few efforts at harmonization or coordination due to America's strong traditions of federalism."

&gt; "Fighting corruption in America tends to be seen as a local concern, with the important exception of the prosecutors and federal agents under the U.S. Department of Justice."

&gt; "The scale of the issue is huge. Sixty-eight per cent of countries worldwide have a serious corruption problem. Half of the G20 are among them."

* Very clean: 100; Highly Corrupt: 0.9

* UK: 81

# Risk factors in FATF RCC

* Risk factors which are most relevant to AML/CFT and AC experts for the detection and tracing of funds and assets related to corruption:

* Politically Exposed Persons and disguising the ownership and source of corrupt funds

* Legal persons and arrangements (use of trusts or non-profit organisations and unjustifiably complex multi-tiered entities)

* Designated Non-Financial Business Professions (DNFBP) (failure as gatekeepers)

* The use of cash (including physical cross-border transportation of cash)

* Control over financial institutions and public entities (e.g. by PEP)

*  . . .

---

# Risk factors in FATF RCC

* Economic sectors

    + Extractive (natural resources) industries

    + Government procurement activities in relation to defence     industry, human health activities, large infrastructure projects

# The Group of Twenty (G20)

* . . .

&gt; "G20 is not an international organisation, but rather what is known as an informal forum. This means it does not adopt decisions that have a direct legal impact. The G20 does not have an administrative council with a permanent secretariat or a permanent delegation of its members. This is why the Presidency, which rotates on an annual basis, plays a particularly important role."

* Various Working Groups including "Anti Corruption Working Group" (ACWG) established in 2010
